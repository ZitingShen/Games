# Game Of Life
We implemented a new algorithm to update the board. Instead of looping through the board and calculating the sum of the surrounding 8 cells for each cell, we only do the calculation for the live cells and the 8 cells around the live cells. Those dead cells which are distant from live ones will always remain dead. To avoid repeating calculation for the same cells, we also use a board to record if the cell is updated or not.
Our original gol.c takes around 48 seconds for the speedtest.txt. The improved faster.c takes around 14 seconds.
Later we applied the concept of parallel computing in the project, further improving the efficiency.
